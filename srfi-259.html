<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Tagged procedures are procedures with boxes attached, which can be used to create applicable records and other abstractions. This SRFI proposes a variant with the notion of a tagging protocol, analogous to a record type definition, for ensuring encapsulation and security for tagged procedures.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None known.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>The rationale of tagged procedures is well explained by the original <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-229/srfi-229.html">SRFI&nbsp;229</a>. That SRFI has a flaw, though, hiding in plain sight within this sentence in its rationale:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, in the context of SRFI 229, one shouldn’t think of procedures falling in just two classes, untagged and tagged ones (note that all procedures may be implementable as tagged ones), but falling into infinitely many classes, one for each type of its tag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since there are infinitely many types of tagged procedures, tagged procedures should themselves be typed. A system of tagged procedures without this feature is somewhat like a system of records built on Scheme vectors and pairs rather than true record types.</p>

<p>Specifically, the value in the tag box of a tagged procedure may be intended, by the usual consumers of the tagged procedure, to imply something about the behaviour of the procedure. But this contract can be broken by mischievous code which takes the tag value from one procedure and attaches it to another procedure which doesn’t have the expected behaviour. In a context where procedure tags might be used for security purposes, that procedure might in fact have some very unwanted nefarious behaviour.</p>

<p>Creating a system of typed tagged procedures, where only the holder of the correct accessor and constructor procedures can directly create tagged procedures of a certain type, makes tagged procedures type safe and suitable for use in security-oriented protocols.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<h3 id="entry:define-procedure-tag"><code>(define-procedure-tag <var class="stx">constructor name</var> <var class="stx">predicate name</var> <var class="stx">accessor name</var>)</code>&nbsp;— syntax</h3>

<p><em>Syntax:</em> The subforms are all identifiers. <code>Define-procedure-tag</code> is a definition form.</p>

<p><em>Semantics:</em> <code>Define-procedure-tag</code> binds the identifiers <code><var class="stx">constructor name</var></code>, <code><var class="stx">predicate name</var></code>, and <code><var class="stx">accessor name</var></code> to three procedures for a newly-created tagging protocol.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code><var class="stx">constructor name</var></code> is bound to a constructor procedure of two arguments, <var>tag</var> and <var>proc</var>. <var>Proc</var> must be a procedure, referred to as the underlying procedure. When invoked, the constructor procedure returns a new procedure object which has identical arity and behaviour as the underlying procedure, but is tagged in the new tagging protocol with the object <code>TAG</code>. If the underlying procedure is already a tagged procedure in some protocol or protocols, the new tag is added in the newly-returned procedure to the existing ones, with the given <var>tag</var>; if one of those protocols is the created tagging protocol, the tag value for this protocol is effectively replaced with the new <var>tag</var> value.</p>
<p>The procedure object returned from the constructor procedure has a fresh location tag and is distinct from all existing procedures in the sense of the <code>eqv?</code>, <code>eq?</code>, and <code>equal?</code> procedures.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><var class="stx">predicate name</var></code> is bound to a predicate procedure of one argument. When this procedure is invoked, it returns <code>#t</code> if its argument is a procedure object that was created by a call to the constructor procedure, or <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><var class="stx">accessor name</var></code> is bound to an accessor procedure of one argument. Its argument is a procedure object created by a call to the constructor procedure, otherwise an assertion violation is signalled. The accessor procedure returns the value of the <var>tag</var> which was provided when the constructor procedure was called.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><code>Define-procedure-tag</code> is generative: every evaluation causes the creation of a new procedure tagging protocol, and the constructor, predicate, and accessor procedures created do not operate on tagged procedures with the protocol from previous or future evaluations of the same <code>define-procedure-tag</code> form.</p>

<p>Procedure tagging protocols do not create a disjoint type: the <code>procedure?</code> predicate answers <code>#t</code> on tagged procedures.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>The following sample implementation is in terms of SRFI&nbsp;229. Of course, if user programs are given direct access to SRFI&nbsp;229, the type safety can be broken.</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>(define-library (srfi 259)
  (export define-procedure-tag)
  (import (scheme base)
          (srfi 229))
  (begin
    (define-record-type Tag
      (make-tag vals)
      tag?
      (vals tag-vals))
    (define-syntax define-procedure-tag
      (syntax-rules ()
        ((_ constructor predicate accessor)
         (begin
           (define key (cons 'constructor '()))
           (define (constructor tag underlying-proc)
             (if (and (procedure/tag? underlying-proc)
                      (tag? (procedure-tag underlying-proc)))
                 (lambda/tag (make-tag
                              (cons (cons key tag)
                                    (tag-vals
                                     (procedure-tag underlying-proc))))
                             args
                             (apply underlying-proc args))
                 (lambda/tag (make-tag (cons (cons key tag) '()))
                             args
                             (apply underlying-proc args))))
           (define (predicate obj)
             (and (procedure/tag? obj)
                  (tag? (procedure-tag obj))
                  (not (not (assq key (tag-vals (procedure-tag obj)))))))
           (define (accessor proc)
             (cond ((assq key (tag-vals (procedure-tag proc)))
                    =&gt; cdr)
